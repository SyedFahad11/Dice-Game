## Dice Game using JavaScript Document Object Model (DOM)
This project is a simple dice game implemented using JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM). The game presents users with a title, "Refresh Me," along with two dice for Player 1 and Player 2.

### How it works
Upon refreshing the webpage, the dice are thrown randomly for both Player 1 and Player 2. Each player receives a random value on their respective dice. The webpage then announces a winner based on whose dice value is higher.
